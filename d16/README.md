# Spider1

This is a web crawler for web scraping. Using this crawler you can scrape following data:

  - Title of the article
  - Author of the article
  - Publishig date
  - Web refecence of the article
  
  
### Installation

Spider1 requires [Scrapy Framework](https://scrapy.org/) to run. If you don't have it, first I recommend to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). In Anaconda you need to create a new environment. Then in your new environment you need to search for Scrapy. Click on it, select it and install it.


### Usage

Spider1 and all others web scrapers in Scrapy environment need a specific commands to run.

First you need to activate your environment in your command line.
For **Windows** you need to enter:
```sh
activate [name of your environment]
```
For **MAC** and **Linux** you need to enter:
```sh
$ source activate [name of your environment]
```
In your scrapy environment you need to enter:
```sh
$ cd
```
and drag and drop a folder with a **Spider1** 

To run a file you need to enter:
```sh
$ scrapy crawl Spider1
```
..and it's going to crawl. All crawled data you will find in d16/tmp file location.

**Enjoy a web crawling!**
